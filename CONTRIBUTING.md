### C# Style Guide

We follow the [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) and use [StyleCop](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop) to enforce these standards.

Some key points:

- Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and property names
- Use camelCase for local variables and parameters
- Prefix private fields with an underscore (_)
- Use var when the type is obvious, otherwise be explicit
- Add XML documentation for all public members
